# AWS ECS Service Connect vs ECS Service Discovery

AWS launched ECS service connect in 2022 re:Invent. ECS connect enables the ECS services to communicate with each other and it also enables external applications to communicate with ECS service. This feature is very similar to ECS service discovery except with service connect, we don't need to write any custom application code to collect traffic metrics any more.
